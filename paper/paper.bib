abstract = {Deep mutational scanning marries selection for protein function to high-throughput DNA sequencing in order to quantify the activity of variants of a protein on a massive scale. First, an appropriate selection system for the protein function of interest is identified and validated. Second, a library of variants is created, introduced into the selection system and subjected to selection. Third, library DNA is recovered throughout the selection and deep-sequenced. Finally, a functional score for each variant is calculated on the basis of the change in the frequency of the variant during the selection. This protocol describes the steps that must be carried out to generate a large-scale mutagenesis data set consisting of functional scores for up to hundreds of thousands of variants of a protein of interest. Establishing an assay, generating a library of variants and carrying out a selection and its accompanying sequencing takes on the order of 4-6 weeks; the initial data analysis can be completed in 1 week.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Measuring the consequences of mutation in proteins is critical to understanding their function. These measurements are essential in such applications as protein engineering, drug development, protein design and genome sequence analysis. Recently, high-throughput sequencing has been coupled to assays of protein activity, enabling the analysis of large numbers of mutations in parallel. We present Enrich, a tool for analyzing such deep mutational scanning data. Enrich identifies all unique variants (mutants) of a protein in high-throughput sequencing datasets and can correct for sequencing errors using overlapping paired-end reads. Enrich uses the frequency of each variant before and after selection to calculate an enrichment ratio, which is used to estimate fitness. Enrich provides an interactive interface to guide users. It generates user-accessible output for downstream analyses as well as several visualizations of the effects of mutation on function, thereby allowing the user to rapidly quantify and comprehend sequence-function relationships. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Enrich is implemented in Python and is available under a FreeBSD license at http://depts.washington.edu/sfields/software/enrich/. Enrich includes detailed documentation as well as a small example dataset.

We developed a new deep mutational scanning statistical model that generates error estimates for each measurement, capturing both sampling error and consistency between replicates. We apply our model to one novel and five published datasets comprising 243,732 variants and demonstrate its superiority in removing noisy variants and conducting hypothesis testing. Simulations show our model applies to scans based on cell growth or binding and handles common experimental errors. We implemented our model in Enrich2, software that can empower researchers analyzing deep mutational scanning data.},

@article{Melnikov2014a,
abstract = {Deep mutational scanning has emerged as a promising tool for mapping sequence-activity relationships in proteins, ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid. In this approach, diverse variants of a sequence of interest are first ranked according to their activities in a relevant assay, and this ranking is then used to infer the shape of the fitness landscape around the wild-type sequence. Little is currently known, however, about the degree to which such fitness landscapes are dependent on the specific assay conditions from which they are inferred. To explore this issue, we performed comprehensive single-substitution mutational scanning of APH(3')II, a Tn5 transposon-derived kinase that confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, in Escherichia coli under selection with each of six structurally diverse antibiotics at a range of inhibitory concentrations. We found that the resulting local fitness landscapes showed significant dependence on both antibiotic structure and concentration, and that this dependence can be exploited to guide protein engineering. Specifically, we found that differential analysis of fitness landscapes allowed us to generate synthetic APH(3')II variants with orthogonal substrate specificities.},

@article{Olson2014,
abstract = {Background: Nonadditivity in fitness effects from two or more mutations, termed epistasis, can result in compensation of deleterious mutations or negation of beneficial mutations. Recent evidence shows the importance of epistasis in individual evolutionary pathways. However, an unresolved question in molecular evolution is how often and how significantly fitness effects change in alternative genetic backgrounds. Results: To answer this question, we quantified the effects of all single mutations and double mutations between all positions in the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). By observing the first two steps of all possible evolutionary pathways using this fitness profile,we were able to characterize the extent and magnitude of pairwise epistasis throughout an entire protein molecule. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach to quantitatively determine the effects of single mutations on structural stability (????GU). This enabled determination of the importance of stability effects in functional epistasis. Conclusions: Our results illustrate common biophysical mechanisms for occurrences of positive and negative epistasis. Our results show pervasive positive epistasis within a conformationally dynamic network of residues. The stability analysis shows that significant negative epistasis, which is more common than positive epistasis, mostly occurs between combinations of destabilizing mutations. Furthermore, we show that although significant positive epistasis is rare, many deleterious mutations are beneficial in at least one alternative mutational background. The distribution of conditionally beneficial mutations throughout the domain demonstrates that the functional portion of sequence space can be significantly expanded by epistasis.},

abstract = {Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation's effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the Escherichia coli TEM-1 {\$}\beta{\$}-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code's architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.},
