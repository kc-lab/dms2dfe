Overview
--------

dms2dfe (**D**\ eep **M**\ utational **S**\ canning (DMS) data to **D**\ istribution of **F**\ itness **E**\ ffects (DFE)) is designed for analyzing Deep Mutational Scaning [1]_ data in terms of Distribution of Fitness Effects.
In cases where biology do not involve actual fitness, fitness can be regarded as a proxy for preferential enrichment.
Here 'Fitness' and 'selection' here basically are conceptually similar to 'fold changes' and 'up/down regulations' in case of differential expression estimations respectively.
