=======================

Creating project directory (`prj_dh`)
-------------------------------------

`configure` script is used for making a new project directory in which a configuration file detailing input parameters of an analysis run can be fed.

.. automodule:: dms2dfe.configure
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. code-block:: text

    prj_dh
    |-- cfg
    |   |-- info
    |   |-- lbls                        : names of samples and corresponding paths to files. 
    |   |   |-- column  varname         : sample names, 
    |   |   |-- column  fhs_1           : paths to input files (.fastq or .sam or .bam or .mut_cds) 
    |   |   `-- column  fhs_2           : paths to reverse (R2) of pair ended .fastq files. 
    |   |-- fit                         : pairs of input (before selection) and selected (after selection) samples.
    |   |   |-- column  unsel           : names of input (unselected) samples, 
    |   |   `-- columns sel_1,sel_2,..  : names of selected samples
    |   |-- comparison                  : pairs of control (eg. untreated) and test (eg. treated) samples to be compared.
    |   |   |-- column  ctrl            : names of control samples, 
    |   |   `-- columns test_1,test_2,..: names of test samples  
    |   |-- repli                       : replicates to be averaged.
    |   |   |-- column  varname         : names of averages samples
    |   |   `-- columns replicate_1,replicate_2,.. : names of replicates
    |   |-- feats                       : custom features.
    |   |   |-- column  aasi            : amino acid number, 
    |   |   `-- columns feat_1,feat_2,..: features (eg. conservation score).
    |   |-- barcodes                    : information about deplexing barcoded .fastq files.
    |   |   |-- column  fastq_R1_fh     : paths to forward (R1) fastq files, 
    |   |   |-- column  fastq_R2_fh     : paths to reverse (R2) fastq files,
    |   |   |-- column  barcode_R1      : sequence of forward (R1) barcode,
    |   |   |-- column  barcode_R2      : sequence of reverse (R2) barcode,
    |   |   `-- column  fastq_fn        : file names of output files.

Please have a look at templates located in `dms2dfe/test_dataset/../cfg` for more details.
    
Envoking analysis pipeline
--------------------------

Once a configuration files are created, the analysis pipeline can be envoked by following command,  

.. automodule:: dms2dfe.pipeline
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
    
Outputs are created in `prj_dh` in directories such as `data_lbl`,`data_fit`,`data_comparison` as described in :ref:`io`.

Additional usage options
---------------------------

In addition to envoking `pipeline`, individual programs can be accessed separately as described in :ref:`programs` section.

Also submodules can be accessed though an API, as described in :ref:`api` section.
